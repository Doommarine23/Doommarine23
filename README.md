### Hi there 👋
I'm a hobbyist game developer / modder, and occasionally delve into software projects outside of games.
I enjoy writing documentation for tools and game engines I'm working with, as well as helping tutor others.

Excuse the dust, this page is going through a slow moving overhaul as I hide/remove projects I've moved on from, add active ones, and create a personal site.
